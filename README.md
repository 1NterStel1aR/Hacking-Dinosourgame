This is Python Program, and must progressed in 3.7.10
And when useing this, if you click this file and it says how much did you multiply speed, that means the dinosouars's speed multiply ( if you input 2, dinosour run 2 time more fast.) And, there is 5 second and you have to go inside the dino game and make the big size you can do( not f11, click the button on the top, square between - and X ). And than, it need 1 second and you must not click or type anything and than it will be start. It didn't need anything like jump.
And your computer size can be different with this person, so please check it that open python file, and type Control and N together, and than copy this.

import pyautogui
import time
time.sleep(2)
for i in range(1):
    print(pyautogui.position())

And than go to dinogame and click F12, and there will be button "console" in top ( if it's english ), And than go to python tab and click F5, go to dinogame and make mouse on the console button. If you can't do this 2 second, just edit time.sleep(2) part to time.sleep("second") ( second will be integer )

If it's same or similar to 1531, 147, it's okay and if not, check all place ( f12 console, console typing, dino )

Last, if it makes error, check it's 3.7.10 ver. or input integer, or you download pyautogui. if you want to download it, go to cmd and input
"pip install pyautogui" and wait few minitues, and goto file again, and than you can do this~
